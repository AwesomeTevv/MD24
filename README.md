# Happy Mother's Day, Mom!

I hope you have an incredible day ❤️

I know its been tough lately, and I'm sorry that you've had to deal with all of that alone. I'm sorry that we weren't there.
But I want you to know how proud I am of you. You are so strong. You can do anything you put your mind to.

I hope you celebrate yourself today. Even though we can't be with you today, enjoy it. You deserve it.
Luckily, you will still be able to be surrounded by people who love you.

Once again, Happy Mother's day.

I love you ❤️
